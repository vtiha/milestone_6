## Milestone Descriptions

### Milestone 1: `equations.py`
This milestone contains a Python script named **`equations.py`**, which implements various mathematical equations and functions. The script serves as a foundational building block for future milestones, showcasing basic programming concepts and problem-solving techniques in Python.

### Milestone 2: 
This milestone includes three Python files:
- **`encrypt.ipynb`**: Implements the Caesar cipher to encrypt messages, allowing users to input a message and a key for secure communication.
- **`decrypt.ipynb`**: Decrypts messages encrypted with the Caesar cipher, using the corresponding key provided by the user.
- **`balanced.ipynb`**: Contains the function is_balanced, which checks if a string of parentheses is balanced, helping to understand basic algorithmic principles.

### Milestone 3
This milestone includes the file **`triangle.py`**, which defines the function `get_triangle(rows: int) -> List[List[int]]`. This function generates Pascal's triangle as a list of lists for a specified number of rows, helping to visualize mathematical concepts.


### Milestone 4
In **`complexity.ipynb`** we focuse on a game involving Alice and Bob, implementing a solution to find pairs of numbers that sum to a target value.

### Milestone 5
This folder contains two files: **`generate_data.ipynb`** and **`report.ipynb`**.

- **`generate_data.ipynb`**: This file generates synthetic employee data, including names, hiring dates, departments, and birthdays, to facilitate testing and development.
- **`report.ipynb`**: This file analyzes the generated employee data and produces reports on hiring anniversaries and birthdays based on a specified month.
